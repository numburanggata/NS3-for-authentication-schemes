    #### Performance Evaluation of a Deployed 4G LTE Network
    0 In Ghana and many countries within Sub-Sahara Africa, Long Term Evolution (LTE) is being considered for use within the sectors of Governance, Energy distribution and transmission, Transport, Education and Health.
    0 Subscribers and Governments within the region have high expectations for these new networks and want to leverage the promised enhanced coverage and high data rates for development.
    0 Recent performance evaluations of deployed WiMAX networks in Ghana showed promising performance of a wireless broadband technology in supporting the capacity demands needed in the peculiar Sub-Saharan African terrain.
    0 The deployed WiMAX networks, however could not achieve the optimal quality of service required for providing a seamless wireless connectivity demands needed for emerging mobile applications.
    0 This paper evaluates the performance of some selected key network parameters of a newly deployed LTE network in the 2600 MHz band operating in the peculiar Sub-Saharan African terrain under varied MIMO Antenna Configurations.
    0 We adopted simulation and field measurement to aid us in our evaluation.
    0 Genex Unet has been used to simulate network coverage and throughput performance of 2X2, 4X4 and 8X8 MIMO configurations of the deployed networks.
    0 The average simulated throughput per sector of 4X4 MIMO configuration was seen to be better than the 2X2 configuration.
    0 However, the percentage coverage for users under the 2x2 MIMO simulation scenario was better than that of the adaptive 4x4 MIMO configuration with 2x2 MIMO achieving 60.
    0 41% of coverage area having throughput values between 1 - 40Mbps as against 55.
    0 87% achieved by the 4x4 MIMO configuration in the peculiar deployment terrain.
